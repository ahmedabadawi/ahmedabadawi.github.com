Programmer, Coder, Geek, Nerd, whatever; generally a Technology Enthusiast. 15+ years of experience professionally developing, designing, architecting and deploying software systems. However, started coding when I was like 10 years; games, hacking, embedded systems. I love Linux and Open Source and my opinions are totally biased and cannot promise any fairness :) Always trying to know how things are made and not take anything for granted, spent collectively years just reading code of HTTP Servers, Databases, even OSs but that is not enough; sometimes I tend to re-invent the wheel. I have been always reluctant of spending time to write down posts or articles because there are a lot more knowledge that can be harvest and there are a lot of material everywere but thought maybe if one sentence that I might write might benefit someone with something it is worth the effort after all.
