As Software Engineers we are always reading books, articles, watching webinars and attending conferences. For me I spend most of my free time reading, can't deny that every thing I read leaves me a better developer and enhance my professional work in a way or another but at the end of the day I can't recall every little detail I read or watched so I thought of creating this repository to try to summarize whatever I'm reading or experiencing during my work or my pet projects and have that knowledge shared so I can access it from anywhere and above all there might be something in there of help to other fellow members of the craft (Software Developers) :)
